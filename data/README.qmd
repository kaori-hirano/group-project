This document renders to a *Markdown* file (and in particular, the Github flavor
of Markdown). On your computer, it may not look very nice, with minimal 
formatting. Once rendered as such, staged, committed, and pushed to Github, 
however it becomes visible as an html in your repo. In this document, you should
briefly describe the datasets you are working with in your project
**including their source, with links if applicable!**

*You should delete this preamble once you update this file for the first time.*

### Codebook

Put the codebook for your data here. Include only variables used in your
analysis. Below you will find one example of formatting a codebook
so that it appears nicely on Github, but it is not the only way.
Note that this .qmd file works like any other Quarto document you have worked with.
You can import/load in data in R with something like `import_function(here::here("data/your_file_name.file_extension")`
to help with creating a codebook. *Delete this paragraph when you update this 
page with information relevant to your project. Replace the code in the chunk 
with code relevant to your project*.

Data is attributed to the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Project (https://doi.org/10.23696/vdemds20) and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network which aggregates data from the Gallup World Poll on happiness, GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption (https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2023/)

`import_function(here::here("data/your_file_name.file_extension")`

civil society repression effort scores, social support
scores, freedom to make life choices, presence of war, presence of coups, participation rate
in civil society, generosity, education, and government corruption. The data sets we will be
using are vdem (democracy) and wellness
