### Codebook

Data is attributed to the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Project (https://doi.org/10.23696/vdemds20)
which provides a multidimensional perspective on democracy beyond elections by 
considering measures including electoral, participatory, egalitarian, deliberative,
and liberal principles in data collection and the Sustainable Development
Solutions Network which aggregates data from the Gallup World Poll on happiness,
GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, 
and corruption (https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2023/).
Further information on the measures used in V-Dem specifically is found in the V-Dem
codebook, found here: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3802627. 
Measures for the happiness data were found in the 2023 statistical appendix, found here https://happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/WHR+23_Statistical_Appendix.pdf.
