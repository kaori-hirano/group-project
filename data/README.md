# Data for Final Project: Predicting Civil Society

### Codebook

Data is attributed to the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Project
(https://doi.org/10.23696/vdemds20) which provides a multidimensional
perspective on democracy beyond elections by considering measures
including electoral, participatory, egalitarian, deliberative, and
liberal principles in data collection and the Sustainable Development
Solutions Network which aggregates data from the Gallup World Poll on
happiness, GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy,
freedom, generosity, and corruption
(https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2023/). Further information on the
measures used in V-Dem specifically is found in the V-Dem codebook,
found here: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3802627.
Measures for the happiness data were found in the 2023 statistical
appendix, found here
