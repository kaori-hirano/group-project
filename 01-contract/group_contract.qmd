# Instructions 

**Please carefully read these instructions.**

To prepare you for teamwork in the working world or a research
environment, you will complete a collaborative final project with a team of your
peers this semester. 

Working in a group presents different challenges than working individually. 
Different work styles can lead to disagreements, which can derail progress
and affect engagement in the course. To help you with establishing ground rules
regarding group work, your first assignment related to the project is the joint
writing of a group contract. This assignment takes the form of a template that
will guide you in developing a division of labor that all members can agree on.

Your team contract template is divided into three major sections:

1. Establishing team procedures
2. Identifying expectations
3. Specifying the consequences for failing to follow these
procedures and fulfill these expectations

Since the basic purpose of this team contract is to accelerate your
team's development, to increase individual accountability for team tasks, and
to reduce the possibility for team conflict, make your contract as specific as
possible: 

(a) specify each task as detailed as possible,
(b) specify each step in a procedure or process as detailed as possible, 
(c) specify the exact person(s) responsible for each specific task, and
(d) specify the exact time and exact place for completion or submission of each
task. The more precisely you describe your team expectations, roles, and 
procedures, the greater chance you have for a successful team experience.

Use the Team Contract template to discuss and finalize your team roles,
procedures, and standards. Write your agreed upon responses in the spaces below.
Once you are finished, each group member must add their own name at the 
bottom of the contract as a signature. **Each group member must commit and push
their own name. We will check!** This is your e-signature on this contract.


Once you are finished, render the document and submit it to the course Canvas
page. Once your team contract has been developed, your team is ready to begin
work on collaborative assignments. 

However, you may soon find that your team is not working as
well as you had hoped. This is normal but needs to be attended to
immediately. Perhaps your team is simply not following the established
contract procedures or roles as strictly as you should be, or perhaps you
need to change some of the procedures or roles as outlined in your contract.
Call a team meeting immediately to discuss and resolve the challenges your
team is facing; do not delay. Seek guidance from your instructor or TA to
resolve any conflicts so that you will have the most positive team experience
possible.

## GROUP CONTRACT (LACOL-ML2023)

Team Members:
James Xia
Kaori Hirano
Alicia Nguyen

## Team Procedures

1. Day, time, and Zoom link for regular team meetings:
- A recurring Zoom link: https://wlu.zoom.us/j/9328076493 
- Tentative meeting time: Sunday at 6 PM
- Probably would create a new When2meet poll to get a weekly meeting at the beginning of every week to make sure everyone can join. 

2. Preferred method of communication (e.g., e-mail, text, Slack, GroupMe, etc.) in order to inform each other of team meetings, announcement, updates, reminders, problems.
- Preferred method of communication: mainly through Slack but for urgent messages, we can communicate through an iMessage group. 

3. Decision-making policy (by consensus? by majority vote?):
- By consensus/compromise. 

4. Method for setting and following meeting agendas (Who will set each agenda? When? How will team members be notified/reminded? Who will be responsible for the team following the agenda during a team meeting? What will be done to keep the team on track during a meeting?):
- We will all decide the agenda of the following meeting at the end of a current meeting. The notes will be kept in the same Google Document where our meeting memos are. We will keep a timeline/table keeping track of the deadlines for each member at the beginning of the Google Document. Each member would keep track of their own task and pay attention to other members' work progress. If a member is behind on their work, they will be reminded through Slack. Every member should turn on notifications for Slack or check Slack at least once per day. 
- The note-taker will be responsible for pushing the agenda and making sure everything is checked off within the desired timeframe.

5. Method of record keeping (Who will be responsible for recording &
disseminating minutes? How & when will the minutes be disseminated?
Where will all agendas & minutes be kept?):
- We will rotate the note-taker role. The note-taking responsibility will be designated at the beginning of every week. The notes will be stored in a shared Google Document, which will be created at the first meeting for project proposal drafting.
