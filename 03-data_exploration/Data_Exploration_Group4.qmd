# Exploring the Data
Answer the following questions:

What is your outcome variable(s)? How well does it measure the outcome you are 
interested in? How does it relate to your hypotheses? What are your key 
explanatory variables? In addition, create a table of summary statistics for 
the variables you are planning to use.

## Merging data - James
```{r load-data}

load("/cloud/project/data/vdemdata-master/data/vdem.RData")

# Merge data by country and year/time

```

## Cleaning data - Alicia 
- Count how many NA observations we have. If it is under %, we will omit the obs.
or we could assign some values to them using given method.
- Deal with country name changes 
- Drop obs or columns not needed 
Create a table of summary statistics for the variables you are planning to use.


Our dependent variable is civil society participation. We will use the predictor 
variables listed above, which include: civil society repression effort scores, 
social support scores, freedom to make life choices, presence of war, 
presence of coups, participation rate in civil society, generosity, education, 
and government corruption.
