# Intro to Slides with Quarto (Delete This Section for Final Presentation!)

## New Slides {.smaller}

- `#` in the text editor creates a *section* header slide, with text in the 
centered in the middle of the slide
- `##` in the text editor creates a *new slide*: the text next to the `##` 
is the title of the slide
- Note also (which you can only see in the `.qmd`) that the `{.smaller}`
code next to a slide title makes the text of that slide smaller (compare the
text size of this slide to the text size in the next slide)

## Bulleted Lists 

- You can use `-` in the text editor to make bulleted lists
- If you want to have bullet points appear click-by-click, you can 
use the **incremental** div:
```
:::{.incremental}
- these bullet points
- will appear click by click
:::
```

## Slide with Columns 

::::{.columns}

## Embedding R Code

- Embedding R code works just like in regular Quarto, using R chunks

```{r}
#| echo: true
mtcars
```

## Visualization

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Customization

- You can change the default aesthetic of your slide show by 
changing the *theme* by using the `theme` YAML option (you have to add it 
in the `revealjs` section, beneath `embed-resources`)
- See [here](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/themes.html) for 
the themes you can use (and adapt - you can also make your own if
you want, see the instructions in the linked page)
- Theme names are put in "quotes"

## Resources

- You find Quarto revealjs documentation [here](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/)
- Meghan Hall also has a [page](https://meghan.rbind.io/blog/quarto-slides/) 
with useful tips

# Presentation Template

## Note

- You do not have to use this format exactly!
- Presentations should be roughly 7 minutes
- Each group member should speak for an equal amount of time
- You can separate sections with section slides but do not have to

## Hypothesis
- The presence of more social cohesive factors--such as region, presence of war, social support, and civil society index--will have strong influences on civil society participation
- Specific focus on 2019 because it is pre-covid 

## Introduction to Topic and Motivation
:::{.incremental}
- Curious about how civil society interacts with society overall
- What is civil society? 
- Political and Social perspective
- Relevance to our daily lives and interests
:::

We are curious about how the civil society participation and societies are mutually affected, so our research question is determining the most essential factors in predicting civil society participation. We hypothesized that characteristics regarding social cohesion--such as region, presence of war, social support, and civil society index--will have large influences on civil society participation rates. The reason we choose to do the happiness dataset and the civil society datasets is because we wish to stand in a broader perspective, seeing the general relationship and taking each national society as a whole, to determine what might be effective for the creation of a civil society. The World Happiness Index gives us social events in a quantitative way and the VDEM provides us with a bunch of indexes measuring the stability of a society from various perspectives. 2019 is the most recent data set we have that is not reflecting social changes due to COVID-19, which is why we chose 2019 specifically over another year. This might be more representative of the social conditions before the pandemic year. 

Based on Jens Steffek and Maria Paola Ferretti's publication of "Accountability or “Good Decisions”? The Competing Goals of Civil Society Participation in International Governance" on 07 Jan 2009, "(civil society participation) may either enhance the democratic accountability of intergovernmental organisations and regimes, or the epistemic quality of rules and decisions made within them." They pointed out the direct cause and effect relationship between civil society participation and the shape of societies. To examine this, we chose to look at the question from both a social and political lens. 



## Introduction to Data
:::{.incremental}
- Data is from the VDEM Group and the World Happiness Index
- We selected variables we thought would relate to civil society, such as social support and GDP
- NAs were replaced with the median value 
- Region was modified to a factor with regional names
- Variables were scaled for regression models
- Civil war and coup were dropped because there were no instances in 2019
:::

::: {.notes}
list some variables when talking about how we chose them
say why NAs were replaced with median briefly
note that variables were scaled because of the wide range (0-1 vs 1-10 etc)

## Highlights from EDA 2: Social Predictors
```{r variable-visualization}
#| message: false
# A scatter plot to show the relationship between civil society participation 
# and social support
viz1 <- ggplot(cs, aes(x=social_support, 
               y = v2x_partipdem)) + 
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x = "Social support",
       y = "Civil society participation",
       color = "Regions")

# A scatterplot to show the relationship between civil society participation 
# and participation in democracy
viz2 <- ggplot(cs, aes(x=cspart, 
               y = v2x_partipdem)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x = "Participation in Democracy",
       y = "Civil society participation")

# A scatterplot to show the relationship between civil society participation 
# and civil society index
viz3 <- ggplot(cs, aes(x=cs_index, 
               y = cspart)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x = "Civil society index",
       y = "Civil society participation")

viz1 + viz2 + viz3 + 
  plot_annotation(title = 
                  "Civil Society Participation vs. Social Predictors")
```
- Social support has a complex relationship 
- Participation in democracy and civil society index appear more linear

::: {.notes}
talk about the relationships present, the right two being somewhat linear but social support has a more complex relationship, just something we needed to keep in mind
tried transforming social support but we didn't find a way to make it more linear

## Inference and Modeling: Regression
```{r test-train-split, echo = FALSE}
# 70, 30 test train split
set.seed(145)
train <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), nrow(cs), replace = TRUE, prob=c(.7,.3))
test <- (!train)
val <- test
```

## Regression
```{r matrix-creation, echo=FALSE}
# create x and y for glmnet
set.seed(129)
x <- model.matrix(cspart ~ csrepress+v2x_partipdem+edu+corr+cs_index+
                           social_support+choices+gen+region+lifee+happ+gdp, 
                  data = cs)[, -1]
y <- cs$cspart
```
## Ridge
- Minimizes the effect of non-influential variables
- hypertuning lambda with CV
- Civil society index, participation in democracy, social support, region, freedom to make life choices were important
- Education, generosity, life expectancy, less so
```{r ridge-regression}
# set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(129)

# cross validation for best l
cv_r <- cv.glmnet(x[train,], y[train], alpha = 0, 
                  # scale the x values 
                  lambda = 10^seq(10, -2, length = 100), scale = TRUE)

# saving optimal lambda
bestlam_r <- cv_r$lambda.min

# calculating MSE
ridge_pred <- predict(cv_r, s = bestlam_r,
newx = x[test, ], scale = TRUE)
ridge_mse <- mean((ridge_pred - y[test])^2)

# fits final ridge model
ridge_mod <- glmnet(x, y, alpha = 0, lambda = bestlam_r, scale = TRUE)

# saves coefficients
coef_r <-coef(ridge_mod)

# prints important coefficients as a table
ridge_feature_estimate <- ridge_mod %>% tidy() %>%
  select(term, estimate)
ridge_feature_estimate_ordered <- ridge_feature_estimate %>% 
  arrange(desc(abs(estimate)))
print(ridge_feature_estimate_ordered)
``` 
## Lasso
- Zeros out non-influential variables
- hypertuning of lambda from CV
```{r lasso-regression}
# set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(18)
 
# cross validation for best l
cv_l <- cv.glmnet(x[train,], y[train], alpha = 1,
lambda = 10^seq(10, -2, length = 100), scale = TRUE)

# saving optimal lambda
bestlam_l <- cv_l$lambda.min

# calculating MSE
lasso_pred <- predict(cv_l, s = bestlam_l,
# scale x values
newx = x[test, ], scale = TRUE)
lasso_mse <- mean((lasso_pred - y[test])^2)

# fits model
lasso_mod <- glmnet(x, y, lambda = bestlam_l, scale = TRUE)

# saves coefficients
coef_l <-coef(lasso_mod)

# prints important coefficients as a table
lasso_feature_estimate <- lasso_mod %>% tidy() %>%
  select(term, estimate)
lasso_feature_estimate_ordered <- lasso_feature_estimate %>% 
  arrange(desc(abs(estimate)))

print(lasso_feature_estimate_ordered)
```
## Tree Methods

## Single Decision Tree
- Visualize importance and relationships between variables and outcome
- Greedy method--may be less generalizable

## Model Comparison
- Random forests was the most effective model of for the data
- Lowest MSE and highest R2
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#| warning: false
# note: I think we are planning to cut this because
# interpretation-wise it doesn't add much that the MSE doesn't
# already cover. 

# putting together data of predicted, actual, and model type
dataplot <- data.frame(true_value = c(y[test], y[test], y[test], y[test]))
dataplot$model_type <- c(rep("Lasso", length(lasso_pred)), rep("Ridge Model", 
            length(ridge_pred)), rep("Tree Model", length(tree_pred_tuned)), 
            rep('Random Forests', length(yhat_rf)))
dataplot$predictions <- c(lasso_pred, ridge_pred, tree_pred_tuned, yhat_rf)

# function giving us R2
r2 <- function(predicted, y) {
  #find SST and SSE
  sst <- sum((y - mean(y))^2)
  sse <- sum((predicted - y)^2)
  #find R-Squared
  rsq <- 1 - sse/sst
}

# setting up values for graph
name=c("Tree","Random Forest", "Lasso","Ridge")
mse_all=c(mse, rf_mse, lasso_mse, ridge_mse)
value=c(r2(tree_pred_tuned, y[test]), r2(yhat_rf, y[test]), 
        r2(lasso_pred, y[test]), r2(ridge_pred, y[test]))

# putting into table
compare_data=tibble(name,mse_all,value)

# table of scores because differences may be hard to tell from graph
model_comp <- tibble('Model' = name, 
                     'MSE' = mse_all,
                     'R-Squared' = value)

# prints table
model_comp
```

## Conclusions & Future Work
:::{.incremental}
- Civil society index, participation in democracy, and region are the most important predictors of civil society participation in 2019
- Life expectancy, civil society repression, and social support may also play a lesser role
- Mostly supports our hypothesis
- Invites further research into how the key predictors interact with each other and the outcome
- Going beyond 2019 because of limitations and predictive power
