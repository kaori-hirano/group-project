This document renders to a *Markdown* file (and in particular, the
Github flavor of Markdown). On your computer, it may not look very nice,
with minimal formatting. Once rendered as such, added, committed, and
pushed to Github, however it becomes visible as an html in your repo. In
this document, you should briefly describe the goal of the project. You
should also describe what is contained in your repo (files, data, etc)
and what their purpose is. Your goal is to help someone recreate your
project if they want to. *You should delete this preamble once you
update this file for the first time.*
